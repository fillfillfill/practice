    <h1>Title</h1>

        <p>Investors bet $27.5 million that Nanotech Energy’s graphene battery breakthrough is the real thing</p>
        <p>The startup claims to be “the world’s top supplier of graphene” and plans to release a non-flammable, 
            environmentally friendly lithium battery that can charge “18 times faster than anything that is 
            currently available on the market” — within the next year.</p>
        <p>US-based battery and graphene technology startup Nanotech Energy just closed a $27.5 million funding
             round at a post-money valuation of $227.5 million, according to the company. 
            The investors were not disclosed. The company has raised more than $30 million since its 2014 founding.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, if Nanotech Energy can realize its claims of cycle life, 
            charge time and energy densities — it will be a profound breakthrough.</p>
